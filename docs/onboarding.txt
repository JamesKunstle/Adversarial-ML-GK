Welcome to our project! The following resources will help you get up to
speed on some necessary technical details of deep learning. 

My suggestion is to work through the Sentdex CNN intro in its entirety and
also to watch as much of Yann LeCun's course as one can, and to use 
Goodfellow's book as reference or for filling in any gaps that LeCun's course
leaves outstanding. From there onward one ought to know where their weak areas
are, and can reference the other documentation as needed.

The paper by Guo et. al. is a predicate for the work done so far, and is a great
illustration of Adversarial Machine Learning.
